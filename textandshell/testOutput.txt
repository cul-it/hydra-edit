     PLANT HYBRIDIZATION BEFORE MENDEL     upon the knobs of the stigmas. In the meanwhile, the stigmas had grad-     ually withdrawn from one another, drawn outward, and finally turned     back on their outer halves against the base of the flower. Their glisten-     ing effect disappeared again gradually with their moisture, and they     became finally covered by the closing and wilting petals. (p. 262.)     The above is given in full for the sake of its natural history     interest, as a type of observation none too common, and for the     sake of showing what K6lreuters spirit was at its best. The     graphic, narrative, and even poetic style of the account should     render it a classic among natural history observations. This closes     an attempt, extensive and somewhat detailed, to give as complete     and exact a presentation of the K6lreuter material as possible.     If the account is somewhat disproportionately extended, it is     nevertheless desirable to have the data from Kblreuters slightly     difficult and sometimes a trifle obscure German rendered as ac-     cessible as possible in English.

NOTE:From 1770-1775, thirty-one articles by K6lreuter, chiefly on zool-     ogical subjects, appeared in the Novi Commentarii Academiae Scientiarum     Imperialis Petropolitanae (Vols. XV-xX, inc.). of these, one only (in     Vol. xx) was upon hybrid plants. In the Acta Academiae Scientiarum     Imperialis Petropolitanae, 1777-1782, appeared seven articles by Kol-     reuter on hybrid plants, and in the Nova Acta of the same Academy,     1783-1796 (Vols. I, HI, X~, XII, XIII), five further papers were published     on the subject of plant hybrids. Unfortunately, it has been impossible     to secure access to the St. Petersburg papers of K6lreuter in time for     their inclusion in the present volume.     2.Spren gel, Christian Konrad.

     PLANT HYBRIDIZATION BEFORE MENDEL157     There appears to be no necessity for the creation of new plants, so     long as one has not already recognized, in those already present, essen-     tial defects or disadvantages, or on the other hand marked advantages.     (ib., p. 145.)     It is interesting here to remember that it is undoubtedly to a     natural cross of these two species that the Grimm variety of al-     falfa is due, which has enabled alfalfa growing to be carried into     the northern border states of the western United States, and the     western provinces of Canada.     Speaking of the crossing of agricultural plants in general,     Lecoq remarks:     It certainly remains highly regrettable that thus far there has been     so little concern about hybridization of agricultural plants, and that it     has been simply left to chance to get varieties, while it would have been     so easy [referring here to beets] to institute with discretion crossing     experiments which certainly would be a new cause of agricultural     riches. (ib., p. 305.)     Lecoq lived before the days of the breeding of the cereals. Al-     luding to the breeding of wheat, he says:     It remains one of the extraordinary human facts, that such a simple     operation, exacting neither time nor money, which can have such large     results, has thus far not been attempted on a plant upon which so many     families of all European lands are fed. (ib., p. 401.)     In conclusion it may be mentioned that Lecoq crossed a variety     of corn called Zea rostrata (corn with pointed or beaked kernels)     with ordinary yellow and red corn, and says:     I completely destroyed the beak. Every single variety of this fine     plant brings out some kind of a change through hybridization, either     in the form of the cobs, or through the variegation of the kernels, or     through entire metamorphosis of the color.

     240PLANT HYBRIDIZATION BEFORE MENDEL     manner that Mendel adopted, viz., by finding out the numerical     relations of the different kinds of character-types among the prog-     eny, and by formulating some law or principle to explain their     ratios. However, it is a matter of interest that Darwin, in the ab-     sence of actual experiments in point, should have come as close     as he actually did to finding an approximation toward a correct     theoretical explanation of what occurs in the cells of hybrids.     Darwins theory was a natural corollary to his doctrine of     pangenesis. It is perhaps strange that, after the publication of     Naudins idea of disjunction, and especially after the phenomenon     of segregation in peas had been noticed by five observers, all of     whose experiments Darwin remarks upon, Darwin himself did not     anticipate, in part at least, Mendels actual experiment. How~     ever, it is a matter of special interest that a priori, in the absence     of experimental data, he should have come as close to the prin-     ciple of the Mendelian explanation as the. above passages seem to     indicate.

     PLANT HYBRIDIZATION BEFORE MENDEL259     mental character as a law of evolution, describing the average     trend of circumstances when a large number of individuals are     taken together without reference to sex. It is an expression of the     law of bodily appearances, and only pretends to describe the con-     dition in the germ cells, as Galton himself observes, insofar as     the bodily characteristics are the outward expression of an in-     ternal germinal condition, which Galton assumed, reasoning re-     versely, must be the case, else why should there be an average     inheritance of the color-characters of the nature described. How-     ever, Galtons expectation that his discovery might be available     for practical breeding purposes has not been entirely justified.     It has indeed proved the value of pedigree records for live stock,     and the general truth of the axiom that like begets like. In a     word, in the light of our present understanding, Galtons Law     is largely an average mathematical expression for the operation     of the law of dominance. It is the most important effort, however,     during what may be called the Darwinian period, at obtaining     an exact statistical expression of the law of inheritance in     populations.
